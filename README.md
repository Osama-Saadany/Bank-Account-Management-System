### :pencil2: Main Function

The `main()` function simulates a series of banking operations:

1. **Account Creation**:  
   The account is created using the named constructor `BankAccount('Osama1007')`, initializing the account ID to `Osama1007` and the balance to `0.0`.

2. **Deposit Scenarios**:  
   - A valid deposit of **500** is made to the account.
   - An **invalid deposit** with a negative value (**-100**) is attempted and rejected.

3. **Withdrawal Scenarios**:  
   - A valid withdrawal of **200** is made, reducing the balance.
   - An **insufficient balance** withdrawal of **400** is attempted and rejected.
   - Another **invalid withdrawal** of **-50** is attempted and rejected.

4. **Final Account Info**:  
   After all the operations, the program displays the account details, including the final balance.

### :books: BankAccount Class

The `BankAccount` class models a bank account with the following features:

- **Constructor**:  
   `BankAccount(this._accountID)` initializes the account with a specified ID and a starting balance of `0.0`.

- **Deposit Method**:  
   The `deposit(double amount)` method ensures that only **positive amounts** can be deposited. It adds the deposit amount to the balance and provides feedback.

- **Withdraw Method**:  
   The `withdraw(double amount)` method ensures the amount is positive and checks if there are sufficient funds in the account before processing the withdrawal.
